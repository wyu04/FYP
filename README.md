### FYP Information
Topics: Identification of Potential Biomarkers of Esophageal Cancer from Gene Expression and Interaction Using Biclustering Algorithm <br>
The main focus of the project is to implement the plaid biclustering model to the gene expression dataset in identifying the possible biomarkers of esophageal cancer. <br>
Besides that, the project also validated that the involvement of protein-protein interactions with the gene expression dataset able to improve the model's performance. <br>

### Code
Get_Gene_Expression_Data.R - using the R environment in order to retrieve gene expression dataset from the NCBI website<br>
biclust.ipynb - the main coding environment used for the study<br>
biclust_data2.ipynb - applying the same coding to another dataset to test for the performance
