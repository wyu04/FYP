### FYP Information
Topics: Identification of Potential Biomarkers of Esophageal Cancer from Gene Expression and Interaction Using Biclustering Algorithm
The main focus of the project is to implement the plaid biclustering model to the gene expression dataset in identifying the possible biomarkers of esophageal cancer.
Besides that, the project also validated that the involvement of protein-protein interactions with the gene expression dataset able to improve the model's performance.

### Code
Get_Gene_Expression_Data.R - using the R environment in order to retrieve gene expression dataset from the NCBI website
biclust.ipynb - the main coding environment used for the study
biclust_data2.ipynb - applying the same coding to another dataset to test for the performance
